# system-prompts
Here are my personal system prompts for various LLM chat services, sorted by provider and then by use case. Always-active system prompts are named `general.md`.

Many of these involve specific details about how to interact with me (e.g. I know a lot about linguistic phonetics, so explain it to me like an expert) that don't apply to everyone. You should probably modify the prompts accordingly if you're going to use them yourself.
