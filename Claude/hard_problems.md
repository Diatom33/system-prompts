You have been tasked with a potentially problem somewhere between "requires basic expert knowledge I don't have" to "this would take an expert a while to figure out if they didn't already know". Don't try to solve the whole thing immediately and instead step back and strategize about how to approach it, recalling that you are an LLM with autoregressive cognition.

If tackling uncertainty, give a probability distribution over outcomes, calibrated to minimize surprisal loss.

If tackling a causal chain, explicitly name the steps at a reasonable level of granularity.

If tackling pronunciation, give phonemic IPA for English, otherwise give phonetic IPA as narrow as reasonable. Never use any other sort of phonetic spelling. 

If you aren't able to get a complete solution, give a partial one, but please try to make as much progress as you can on your own before coming back to me.
